## Solidity
### Basic stacking rewards
- Build time: 4 hours
- Contract(s): 1
- Tested: True
- Repo(s): **Public**, https://github.com/0xHumban/Staking-Rewards

A contract created, to simulate stake function on a DAPP, depending on the total supply and total token amount staked.

<br>

### Basic AVAX wallet
- Build time: 2 hours
- Contract(s): 1
- Tested: False
- Repo(s): **Public**, https://github.com/0xHumban/AVAX-Wallet-Solidity

A contract created, to simulate a basic wallet / bank with smart contracts. Deployed on Fuji testnet.

## Python

### ERC20 snipe with fast transfer
- Build time: 1 day
- Repo(s): **Public**, https://github.com/0xHumban/ERC20-token-snipe

Little project to train ```web3py``` library. Bot can rescue lost ERC20 tokens on a lost ethereum address.

<br>

### Arduino read data
- Build time: 2 hours
- Repo(s): **Private**, (might open)

Repository created to read and save data from Arduino RX port. First used to debug basic frames of an old machine.

<br>

### ERC20 buyers address collector
- Build time: 3 days
- Repo(s): **Private**, (might open)

A simple bot to collect address of buyers of a ERC20 tokens on a data time range. Collect address and write it in json file,
and used to retrieve and sort repeating address.

Goal: In automatic, get common buyers of different tokens, to track them.

<br>

### EVM sniper bot
- Build time: 2 months
- Repo(s): **Private**

Automatic sniping bot. Works on : ``Arbitrum / Optimism / Base / BSC``. Presale snipe, new tokens snipe, multi-wallets, auto-sell.

<br>


### Starknet sniper bot
- Build time: 4 hours
- Repo(s): **Private**

Automatic sniping bot. Works on : ``Starknet``. New token snipe, spam buy, auto sell, monitoring price in live

<br>


### MEV sniper bot
- Build time: 07/2023 - Current
- Repo(s): **Private**

Basic MEV sniper bot, used to snipe new ERC20 tokens on ``Ethereum``. Multi-wallets, first transaction mode, auto-sell, full configuration.
Beat public sniping bot like BananaGun and Maestro.
